        <h1>How I did the service</h1>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
          For the service part of my project, I really wanted to emphasize
          donations in order to help bridge the pay gap gender wise as well as
          ethnicity wise. The first link is a gofundme centered around helping
          with racial justice. With the donation, this organization will find
          different non-profits within the racial justice space that need money
          and allocate the money to them. This will help black people all over
          America rise up and this in turn will reduce the racial wage gap. The
          second link is called Ladies Get Paid, and by signing up and making a
          donation, you are supporting the organization that helps women in the
          workplace get jobs and rise up above the gender wage gap. By donating,
          you are in turn helping reduce the gap because this organization
          directly helps with this. What I did for the service part of the
          project was post the link on social media platforms such as Instagram,
          Snapchat, and LinkedIn in order to reach a wide number of potential
          donors.
